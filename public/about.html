<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a first-year undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Information Science and 
  Engineering at Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering. I have a strong interest in technology, software
   development, and practical problem-solving. I take a proactive approach to learning and consistently 
   seek clear understanding of core concepts such as programming, algorithms, and system fundamentals.
</p>

<p>I engage actively in both academic and extracurricular settings and handle tasks that require structure, clarity, and attention to detail. Whether I am drafting formal communication, analysing technical information, or working through academic challenges, I focus on accuracy and effective execution.
